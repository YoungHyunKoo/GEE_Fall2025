        "The image we just draw on the map is a **true color** image. True color image means that it is visualized by the way we normally see with our eyes. Every color we see is determined by the composition of three components of light (R, G, B). In a true color image, red band is assigned to red component, green band is assigned to green component, and blue band is assigned to blue component; this is the exactly same to what we see with our eyes. However, we can also create a **false color** image. For example, if we assign near-infrared band (0.85-0.88 μm; band 5) to red component, red band (0.64-0.67 μm; band 4) to green component, and green band (0.53-0.59 μm; band 3) to blue component, then this false color image is pretty diffent with what we see in the real world. We can use this false color image to highlight some features (e.g. vegetation, water, etc.)"
